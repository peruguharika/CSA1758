Aim:
To solve the N-Queens problem by placing n queens on an n Ã— n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other, and to count and display all valid solutions.

Algorithm:
1.Initialize:Use an array board where board[r] stores the column index of the queen placed in row r.
2.Use a counter (solutions) to track the total number of solutions.
Safety Check:
3.Implement is_safe(r, c) to ensure the queen in row r and column c does not conflict with queens in earlier rows:
4.No other queen is in the same column.
5.No other queen is on the same diagonal.
6.Recursive Backtracking:
7.Define place_queens(r) to try placing a queen in each column of row r.
8.If r == n, a valid solution is found. Increment the solution counter and print the board.
9.Otherwise, for each column, check safety and recursively place queens in the next row.
10.Print Board:
11.Display the board configuration for each solution.
